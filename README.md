CW: colonialism, lots of death; language change since publication. I refer specifically to the sentence in chapter 14 that reads "His landlady came to the door, loosely wrapped in dressing gown and shawl; her husband followed, ejaculating." Dearest gentle reader: at the time Wells was writing, "ejaculation" referred to *speech*. Its change to its present meaning began no earlier than the 1910s. But I have not changed it or glossed it internally, so readers unaccustomed to Victorian language use use may get *entirely the wrong idea* of the scene Wells is painting here.
